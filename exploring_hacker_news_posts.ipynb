    "# Exploring Hacker News (HN) Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "### In which I ponder whether to ask or to show, and to stay beautiful or to be less youthful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I actually have a question that lingers in my mind, and [Hacker News (HN)](https://news.ycombinator.com/) seems like an appropriate place to ask. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, this guided project from Dataquest will help me explore the HN posts by analyzing these questions:\n",
    "1. **Do 'Ask HN' or 'Show HN' receive more comments on average?** 'Ask HN' is a post with a specific type of question, for example, [\"Side projects that are making money, but you'd not talk about them?\"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23438930), I bet you'd want to take a peek on this post haha.. and 'Show HN' is about interesting contents, could be a project or product, such as [\"Anytime, a Simple Time Converter\"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23437682). None of these were created by me, I just happened to stumble upon the posts and I think they're interesting!\n",
    "2. **Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?** I'll refer to that neat 'Anytime' time converter stated above for the timezone name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are other more important factors, such as the relevancy of the posts and whether the topic is general and/or popular or very niche. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my case, my question is quite niche and unpopular (trust me, I've searched the entire HN and found little to non-existent posts), so I don't really expect to get answers if I create an 'Ask HN' post. I even consider maybe I need to gauge the users' interest on that particular topic first by creating a 'Show HN' post and, if the points are high, then I can proceed with 'Ask HN'. Anyway! That sounds like me getting ahead of myself. Let's just keep things simple first and weigh the time factor and work from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), and it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing no-comments submissions, and then randomly sampled from the remaining submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, since I'm blabbering too much already, let's begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "*...oh, btw, my question is: \"What are the best Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) related to clinical/medical/healthcare informatics?\" Please contact me if you happened to know the answer, thanks :)* "
